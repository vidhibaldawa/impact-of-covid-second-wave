        </header>
       
        <p>Since February 2021, countless lives have been lost in India, which has compounded the social and
            economic devastation caused by the second wave of COVID-19. The sharp surge in cases across
            the country overwhelmed the health infrastructure, with people left scrambling for hospital beds,
            critical drugs, and oxygen. As of May 2021, infections began to come down in urban areas. However,
            the effects of the second wave continued to be felt in rural areas. This is the worst humanitarian and
            public health crisis the country has witnessed since independence; while the continued spread of
            COVID-19 variants will have regional and global implications.</p>

        </div>
            <p>With a slow vaccine rollout and overwhelmed health infrastructure, there is a critical need to examine
            India's response and recommend measures to further arrest the current spread of infection and to
            prevent and prepare against future waves. This brief is a rapid social science review and analysis of
            the second wave of COVID-19 in India. It draws on emerging reports, literature, and regional social
            science expertise to examine reasons for the second wave, explain its impact, and highlight the
            systemic issues that hindered the response. This brief puts forth vital considerations for local and
            national government, civil society, and humanitarian actors at global and national levels, with
            implications for future waves of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

            <p>The second wave has left public healthcare in shambles. People have lost their lives due to lack of proper
                 medical facilities and infrastructure. The situation is getting a little under control in the cities, but 
                 it is still very grim in rural India where there are issues related to access to medical facilities,
                  hospitals, doctors, technically trained staff or testing facilities.Around 65% Indians out of the total population of approximately 1.3 billion live in rural India which
                hardly has rural health infrastructure. As per the Rural Health Statistics 2019, there is a shortfall
                 of 43,736 Sub Centres (23 percent), 8764 Primary Health Centres/PHC (28 percent) and 2865 Community
                  Health Centres/CHC (37 percent) across the country.</p>

             <p>India is experiencing the second wave of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
                  It has affected the Indian population at an alarming rate and has so far infected 25 385 043 people,
                   and has taken 280 683 innocent lives (18 May 2021, 8:02 p.m. IST). The second wave is spreading 
                   rapidly and has severely affected the country recently. In the current COVID-19 scenario, there is
                   a sharp surge in the daily positivity rate, increasing from 1.62% on 1 March 2021 to ~20% on 13 May
                    2021. The resources have started to exhaust quickly. Hospitals have no ICU/isolation wards left; 
                    life-saving drugs are finishing quickly; oxygen supplies are interrupted and dead bodies are lying 
                    everywhere.</p>

              <p>It was the third week of April when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started to 
                 pread more rapidly than ever and recorded a massive surge when the daily number of cases crossed the
                 2-lakh mark. The poor governance, causal and ignorant behaviour of the public enabled the virus to 
                stretch its influence and subsequently gave rise to the second wave. The  situation wasout of control.Compared
                 to the first wave, the second wave has created more havoc. During the first wave, the central 
                 government immediately imposed a countrywide lockdown, restrictions on international travel
                 and several other strict measures (COVID appropriate behaviour) before the cases could surge.
                 The first wave achieved its highest peak in September 2020, where the daily confirmed cases
                 reached up to ~0.1 million cases.</p>

                 <div class="box-b">
                    <img src="https://assets.thespinoff.co.nz/1/2020/04/Covid-19-Bubbles-apartment-gymandpool-02.gif"  height="250px" width="400px">
                    <span> &ldquo; Stay in Your Bubble,Stay Safe &rdquo;</span>
              </div>

                 <p>The country underwent the world's largest and strictest lockdown in different phases
                    from 25 March 2020 to 31 May 2020, followed by unlocking. This somehow helped the
                    public/government prepare for the worst situation and manage the first wave, which
                      is lacking in the present case. Over time, both the public and the government 
                  started to take things casually and completely ignored the ongoing pandemic. 
                Mass gatherings (protest/rallies/elections/festival celebrations),1 non-compliance
                ith COVID protocols and slow vaccination (~2% population fully vaccinated) 
                contributed to increased infections. Scientists had already warned to stop
                 pilgrimages and mass gatherings in the recent past, yet the government went
                ahead to allow such gatherings this year.</p>

                <p> The second wave is mainly affecting the younger populations. However, a
                     declined trend is seen in the case fatality rate from 3.5% in 2020 (mid-April)
                    to 1.2% in 2021 (mid-April). The scary part is that compared to the previous
                      year, the virus has mutated in more devastating strains and is infecting the
                    young populations exponentially.  </p>

    <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON INDIA'S ECONOMY</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>As per the official data released by the ministry of statistics and program implementation, 
        the Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in the April-June quarter of this fiscal year. This is
         the worst decline ever observed since the ministry had started compiling GDP stats quarterly
          in 1996.</li><li> In 2020, an estimated 10 million migrant workers returned to their native places 
          after the imposition of the lockdown. But what was surprising was the fact that neither the 
          state government nor the central government had any data regarding the migrant workers who
           lost their jobs and their lives during the lockdown.</li>

    <li> government extended their help to migrant workers who returned to their native places during the
 second wave of the corona, apart from just setting up a digital-centralized database system. The
  second wave of Covid-19 has brutally exposed and worsened existing vulnerabilities in the Indian 
  economy.</li><li> India’s $2.9 trillion economy remains shuttered during the lockdown period, except for 
  some essential services and activities. As shops, eateries, factories, transport services, business
   establishments were shuttered, the lockdown had a devastating impact on slowing down the economy.
    The informal sectors of the economy have been worst hit by the global epidemic. India’s GDP contraction
     during April-June could well be above 8% if the informal sectors are considered. Private consumption 
     and investments are the two biggest engines of India’s economic growth. All the major sectors of the
      economy were badly hit except agriculture. </li><li> Indian economy was facing headwinds much before the 
      arrival of the second wave. Coupled with the humanitarian crisis and silent treatment of the government, 
      the covid-19 has exposed and worsened existing inequalities in the Indian economy. The contraction of the
       economy would continue in the next 4 quarters and a recession is inevitable.</li><li> Everyone agrees that the
        Indian economy is heading for its full-year contraction. The surveys conducted by the Centre For Monitoring
         Indian Economy shows a steep rise in unemployment rates, in the range of 7.9% to 12% during the April-June 
         quarter of 2021. The economy is having a knock-on effect with MSMEs shutting their businesses.</li> <li>Millions of 
         jobs have been lost permanently and have dampened consumption. The government should be ready to spend billions
          of dollars to fight the health crisis and fast-track the economic recovery from the covid-19 instigated 
          recession. The most effective way out of this emergency is that the government should inject billions of 
          dollars into the economy.</li>

<li>The GDP growth had crashed 23.9% in response to the centre’s no notice lockdown. India’s GDP shrank 7.3% in 2020-21.
 This was the worst performance of the Indian economy in any year since independence. As of now, India’s GDP growth 
 rate is likely to be below 10 per cent. </li> </ul>

    <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON EDUCATION</summary>
    
    <ul><li>Let us begin with a fact: The plan to return students to physical classrooms has suffered a major setback in the
         last few weeks, with the country witnessing a second wave of Covid-19 cases that is worse than the peak in 2020.
          Another set of lockdowns seems imminent, with no telling when the situation will be back under control.</li>

         <li> That said, there is a silver lining to this cloud. Eventually, the government and educational institutions
         do want to facilitate a return to offline pedagogy. The current delay gives them more time to formulate a
          better roadmap for ensuring a safer transition back to school-based learning.</li>
        
       <li> Some may question whether a return is necessary. After all, e-learning has been on the rise during the pandemic 
        and is being heralded as the future of education.</li>
        
      <li>  However, while online pedagogy does a great job of supplementing offline education, it does not serve as the
         latter’s replacement. This holds especially true in a developing economy such as India for several reasons.</li>
       
       <img   src="education.jpg" border="4px solid black" width="400px" height="340px" align="right">
        <br><br> <b>Why India cannot do without offline learning in the long run</b><br>
       <br> <li>To begin with, the digital medium can’t replicate the interpersonal interactions that schools facilitate by bringing together young children from different backgrounds and cultures. In essence, they act as a melting pot of ideas and perspectives that serves to broaden the learners’ perspective.
        
      
       </li><li> Interacting with their peers between classes also help students develop their social skills essential to their holistic growth and development.
        
        </li><li>Another aspect is that of equitable access. India is infamous for its wealth gap; a 2020 Oxfam report highlighted how the country’s richest 10% own almost three-fourths (74%) of its wealth.
        
       </li><li><b> This means that, of the 320 million learners calling India home, a significant percentage does not have the same access to digital facilities as their more privileged peers do.</b></li>
       <li> This disparity is further complicated by the digital divide between urban and rural India, leading to issues with consistency and quality of learning.</li>

    <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON INDIA'S AGRICULTURE</summary>
    <img   src="agriculture.jpeg" width="300px" height="150px" border="4px solid black" align="left">
    <p>The second wave has seen stricter and longer lockdowns in the rural parts of the country. Due to the lockdowns, 
        APMC Mandis have been closed for operations or have taken such steps voluntarily. Specifically, APMC Mandis in 
        Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra were closed during the peak harvesting season. Farmers were not prepared for
         the ensuing chaos. As the Mandis have still not opened fully, crops are rotting in the fields. Due to the closure
          of Mandis, vegetable vendors, and processing industries have also been hit. We can see the contrasting impact of
           the first and the second wave in the agriculture wage growth data. The average wage growth for the agriculture
            sector for the period of November 2020 to March 2021 has reduced to 2.9 percent (2nd wave) from 8.5 percent in
             April to August 2020 (1st wave).</p>

<details> 
    <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON INDIA'S MANUFACTURING</summary>
   
    <p>Manufacturing was at the receiving end in both the first and the second wave. To control the coronavirus spread,
         most of the manufacturing sector had to work at a lesser capacity or shut down. Non-essentials manufacturing was
          hit for longer and with more severe restrictions. The fear of prolonged lockdowns led to migration back to 
          villages. In addition, the global and local supply chains had also not fully normalized after the first wave.
           This has meant higher cost of procuring raw materials for both small and large industries.  As per the IHS
            Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) in May 2021, PMI slumped to 50.8  from 57.5
             reported in February. It is at a ten-month low.</p>
</details> 
<details> 
    <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON INDIA'S SERVICES</summary>
    
    <p>The services sector in the last two decades has become the bedrock of the Indian economy contributing to more than
         half of the GDP. But, our services and knowledge-based industries have been built on the manufacturing industry
          premise of the 18th century i.e. proximity and discipline of workers to the factory is critical in getting good
           output. We apply the same philosophy for our software engineers and telecalling workforce. With the internet
            revolution this premise has proven to be an unnecessary legacy of the past. Now the workforce can be
             decentralized and anyone can work from anywhere till the time there is 4G internet. I do believe that COVID 
             will prove a positive disruption for the services sector in the long run.

        The first wave required a steep learning curve for the organizations to develop infrastructure and processes
         for remote working. For the employees, first wave lockdowns were a new paradigm and it took them some time
          to adjust to work from home and be productive. Prolonged lockdown and unlocking phases during the first wave
           ensured that both the employer and employee got into a rhythm and the productivity started reaching pre-covid
            levels. The second wave disrupted this rhythm. But the impact of the second wave has been localized and 
            centered around groups of people with typical disruptions costing 3-4 weeks of productivity. My assessment 
            is that the services sector will be the least hit from wave 2 from an output standpoint.</p>
    </details>
 
<details> 
   <summary>IMPACT OF SECOND WAVE ON INDIA'S GDP</summary>
   
   <p>On May 31, the Indian government released the data for GDP that during the financial year 2020-21, GDP contracted by 
       7.3 percent. It is the most severe contraction from the time India got its independence. The reasons behind this 
       trajectory are obvious – lockdown leading to the closing of business units, increasing unemployment rate and a
       significant decline in domestic consumption.

    For the current financial year, the Reserve Bank of India has anticipated growth of 10.5 percent. But the rating 
    agencies across the globe have downgraded it due to the impact of the second wave of COVID-19. Moody’s initially
     projected 13.7 percent of growth for FY 2021-22, but later lowered it to 9.3 percent. The same goes with S&P Global
      Rating. They have lowered the 11 percent growth to 9.8 percent in case of moderate impact of the second wave, but
      for a worst-case scenario, it would be 8.2 percent. The ideas around a third wave are not helping the situation at 
      all.</p>
